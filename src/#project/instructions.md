# Instructions

You have been provided a PSD with a design of an interior page of a website. Please take this asset and turn it into a fully functional static page that could be used for integration with a yet to be determined CMS. This will be a much larger site than a single page, and your code should be written to be flexible and reusable throughout the site. Show us your best start to a code base that will be scalable, flexible, maintainable, semantic and accessible. Build in a progressively enhanced manner - attention to detail should be high, but minor aesthetic details may differ depending on the native functionality of each required browser. As you make these decisions, justify them in a read-me file.

## Challenge Requirements

 - Browser Support
 	 - IE7+
 	 - Chrome - Latest Stable Release
 	 - Firefox - Latest Stable Release
 	 - Safari - Latest Stable Release
 - Pixel Perfection
 	 - Make sure the design matches the PSD in all required browsers
 - Frameworks, Plugins, and Polyfills
 	 - With the exception of jQuery, please avoid frameworks, plugins and polyfills for HTML, CSS, & JS - We’d like to see what you’re capable of doing when handcrafting your own code
 - Carousel
 	 - The carousel should support up to a max of 4 images but there may be less when integrated with the back end
 	 - The carousel should auto-rotate on page load and stop rotating when the user interacts with it, continuing its rotation once the user is no longer in the hit area of the carousel.
 - Media
 	 - Please use the images in the PSD and not placeholder images
 	 - Videos do not need to play
 - Twitter Widget
 	 - Please embed a standard Twitter widget for the user @crispinmulberry and include a working copy in the code
 - Ads
 	 - Use static images for the ads, no integration is necessary
 - Forms
 	 - Forms do not need to submit, but should be marked up appropriately to be a functional form


When you have completed the code challenge, please email a zip file of all the assets and provide a URL to a working copy. Also include any notes or documentation you feel are necessary. Thanks and good luck!
